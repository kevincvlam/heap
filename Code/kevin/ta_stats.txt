Past TAships: 2
Other experience: In the spring of 2006, I taught a preparatory course for the physics section of the Medical College Admissions Test. I was employed by the Princeton Review. I taught 2 sections of 30 students for 3 hours per week (i.e., 30 students for 3 hours on one day, then 30 other students for 3 more hours on another day). The material I taught was a the first year university level. I created my lessons based on the contents of a textbook. In the fall of 2009, I taught a 1-hour tutorial twice per week for CSC 180 at the University of Toronto. In the winter of 2010, I marked assignments and exams for CSC 369 at the University of Toronto.

Other experience: I taught English in China for 1 year at Lanzhou University in 2003-4. The position was very TA-like. I would see 14 classes (20-40 students) once every 2 weeks, while most of their classes were taught by a Chinese English teacher.
