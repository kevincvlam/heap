student* mostConstrainedTA:
- numTeachable: keep track of number of courses* that are WILL or better (in student struct).
- TA with least number of courses they are able to teach will be most constrained
* maybe we can only look at the courses that still need TAs to fit the other constraint, not sure though

for every ta
	if (the ta is guaranteed hours && mostConstrainedTA->numTeachable==1)
		assign ta to that course automatically
