/* Initialization */
Each TA has its own table of potential courses

The TA itself has a data structure storing all his/her characteristics


/* First Pass, Evaluating the Preference and Qual's */

FOR ONE TA:

Each course has a score of zero, based on his characteristics, the score 
increments or decrements. 

At the end of this process, the courses are then sorted in most suited for to
least suited for. (Ie. in decreasing score)

/* Algorithm */


for every course
  for all the characteristics
    if characteristic is relevant to course
       change score accordingly
    end if
  end for
end for 

/* Other Ideas */

What about owed TAships? How do COMBINATIONS of characteristics interact
with each other? Someone who has a course as his 1st choice AND is owed a TAship
 for example.

Should we try to develop a fitness or happiness score based on the input of a
certain TA assignment? That way we try to optimize this score.


/* Other functions for this week */
Once we rank the courses based on suitability. Maybe we can use a genetic algorithm or some other algorithm to try to optimize the assignment.

Such that the total sum of the course scores it highest, subject to the 
constraint of fulfilling TAships owed. 

Then from there we keep building up layers of iteration to a more
optimal solution... ?
